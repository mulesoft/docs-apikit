= To Update a WSDL

In this procedure, you regenerate SOAP flows. After modifying a WSDL, such as adding an operation or editing a message, regeneration is required. Because modifying a WSDL is error-prone, before making a change, make a backup, change the attribute, and verify that the change worked.

To update a WSDL file:

. Download `+https://docs.mulesoft.com/apikit/v/3.x/_attachments/tshirt-modified.wsdl+`, copy the entire contents of the downloaded file, and paste it in tshirt2.wsdl, replacing the tshirt2.wsdl content.
+
. In Package Explorer, right-click the project and select Mule > Generate SOAP Flows.
+
A new flow named DeleteOrder:api-config appears.
