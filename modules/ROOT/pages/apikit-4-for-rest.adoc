APIkit for REST is a framework designed to simplify the development and integration of RESTful APIs. REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for building web services. With APIkit for REST, you get a set of tools and features to streamline REST API development while ensuring compliance with industry standards.

APIkit for REST fully supports RAML (RESTful API Modeling Language) and OAS (OpenAPI Specification), which are widely adopted formats for describing RESTful APIs. By leveraging RAML or OAS, you can define your API contracts, enabling consistent design, enhanced collaboration, and clear documentation.

== Features

* *Automatic Validation*: APIkit for REST automatically validates incoming requests against your API contracts defined in RAML or OAS. This ensures that requests adhere to the specified rules and constraints of the API.

* *Code Generation*: The framework provides code generation capabilities that help streamline the implementation of your RESTful APIs. APIkit for REST generates implementation templates based on your API contracts.

* *Intelligent Routing*: With APIkit for REST, incoming requests are intelligently routed to the appropriate endpoints based on the defined API contracts. 

APIkit for REST is a tool for efficient REST API development and integration. By leveraging its features and adhering to industry standards, you can accelerate your API development lifecycle, improve collaboration, and deliver high-quality RESTful APIs.
