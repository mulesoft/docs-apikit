The following procedure describes how to retrieve the RAML definition of an API generated by APIkit 3.7.x and earlier. The API must be deployed and accessible, not blocked by a policy, for example. You can use an HTTP client, such as Postman, to obtain the RAML definition.

. Set up a *GET* request.
. Use the following syntax to construct the URL:
+
`<baseURL>/console/api/?raml`
+
. Set a Headers key to *Accept* and the value to *application/raml+yaml*.
. Send the request.
+
The RAML code and any included files appear in the *Body* section.
