= To Simulate API Calls

Simulating calls to the API is a critical design task that helps you troubleshoot problems and demo the API to prospective users even before you have implemented it. The simulation depends on certain parts the RAML:

* An examples of data the actual implementation would return
* An HTTP status codes and responses the API returns

////
You can use the mocking service in API Console to provide a base URI for an API you havenâ€™t implemented yet.
////

When you simulate a valid request to the API and all goes well, API Console returns the status code 200 and example data.

// The Enterprise Edition of APIkit uses DataWeave for generating a mocked implementation that simulates calls to the API based on the examples provided in a RAML definition.

In this procedure, you locate the URL for API Console. You enter the URL in a browser to simulate calls to the API. This procedure assumes you just finished running the APIkit project to generate a Mule flow. In the simulation, you make a call to consume a JSON resource and filter user information.

. In Studio, click the basepoint URL, `http://localhost:8081/console/`, that appears in APIkit Consoles.

+
Your default browser opens
+
The API Console appears showing an API summary and information about the project, such as the version and protocol.

+
. Click the hamburger menu, or expand the width of your browser, if necessary to display simulation controls for API resources.

+
. In API Summary, click GET for the `/users` resource.
+
The HTTP 200 response indicating success and the JSON example you expect for the `/users` resource appears.
+

+
. In API Summary, click the `users` resource to see documentation about methods and sub-resources.
. In API Summary, expand `/userbyid`. Click GET for the `/usersbyid` resource, and click Try It.
+
Parameters and Headers tabs appear where you can add query parameters and headers to requests.
+
. Check Show Optional Parameters, and click Send.
+
The HTTP 200 response indicating success appears. The JSON example for the `/usersbyid` resource, which is the user information for the user having id 3, appears.

. Hover over the controls in the Details section to see what you can do with the content of the simulation:
+
* Copy content to clipboard
* Save content to file
* View with highlighted syntax
* Preview response
* Wrap or unwrap text

Now, you are ready to implement the endpoint.
