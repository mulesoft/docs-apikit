= Transforming to SQL Query
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]

endif::[]

You can transform the input OData `GET` request to an SQL SELECT query by using the `Transform to SQL Select` operation. This operation is useful when combined with the `select` operation of the Anypoint Connector for Database (Database Connector). 

image::transform-to-sql-transformer.png["*Transform to SQL select* element and *Entity set name* field highlighted"]

The output payload is a prepared statement and the attributes are a map of prepared statement parameters.

You can use this operation to work with the Mule DB connector to expose databases with OData V4.

APIkit supports the following elements:

* System query options:
** $filter
** $select
** $search
** $orderby
** $skip
** $top
* Single entity
* Entity relation
* Server-side pagination

APIkit does not support the following elements:

* Parameter Aliases
* Built-in Filter Operations:
** has
** divby
* Built-in Query Functions, all except:
** contains
** startswith
** endwith
* $apply
* $compute
* $expand

== Transform to SQL Select Operation in OData V4

The OData protocol defines a series of conventions that enable clients to query identified resources by using URLs.
The list of queryable entities, their fields, and the relationships between them are defined in a data model by using HTTP messages.
OData shares some similarities with Java database connectivity (JDBC). The `transform-to-sql-select` operation uses such similarities to help you create SQL queries for the resources.
The operation results in a message that has a prepared statement with the SQL `select` sentence as the payload and the parameters name and values map as the attributes.

== Implement the Transform to SQL Select Operation Using APIkit for OData V4

You can implement the transform to SQL operation with the `<apikit-odata:transform-to-sql-select>` XML element, which has the following parameters:

[options="header"]
|====
| Parameter name | Description
| Display name | Name of the operation
| Module configuration | Name of the related-module configuration
| Entity set name | Name of the entity set to fetch #[attributes.entitySetName]
| Page size | A number that defines the amount of results per page during server-side-pagination
| Entity type name | String obtained from the OData request by using #[attributes.odataRequestAttributes], which the entity data model specifies
| Entity type fields | An array of strings obtained from the OData request using #[attributes.odataRequestAttributes], which provides the list of property fields from the entity type
| Entity type keys | An object obtained from the OData request using #[attributes.odataRequestAttributes], which provides the map of entity key names and values
| System query options | Parameter obtained from the OData request using #[attributes.odataRequestAttributes]
| Search transformation enabled | Enables $search transformation to WHERE clause
| Strict search term match | Enables full term match for $search. If enabled, terms in WHERE clause are not enclosed between '%'.
| SQL identifiers delimiter a| Option that delimits identifiers in the generated SQL sentence (Options: DOUBLE_QUOTES, BRACKETS, and BACK_TICKS)

Examples:

* DOUBLE_QUOTES: ``SELECT "TrackId", "Name" FROM "Tracks"``

* BRACKETS: ``SELECT [TrackId], [Name] FROM [Tracks]``

* BACK_TICKS: ``SELECT \`TrackId`, \`Name` FROM \`Tracks` ``

| SQL limit rows a| Option that limits the numbers of rows (Options: LIMIT and FETCH_NEXT_ROWS_ONLY)

Examples:

* LIMIT: ``SELECT OrderID, ShippedDate, ShipCountry FROM Orders LIMIT :parameter1``

* FETCH_NEXT_ROWS_ONLY: ``SELECT OrderID, ShippedDate, ShipCountry FROM Orders ORDER BY OrderID ASC OFFSET :parameter2 ROWS FETCH NEXT :parameter1 ROWS ONLY``

`ORDER BY` is automatically included if not present in the request using the entity key defined in CSDL.

== $filter Expressions in OData V4

​​The `$filter` expression in OData uses comparison, logical, arithmetic, and grouping operators. You can access the list operators with their corresponding meaning at http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata/v4.01/cs01/part1-protocol/odata-v4.01-cs01-part1-protocol.html#sec_BuiltinFilterOperations[the OData4 Specification^]. APIkit does not support `has` and `divby` operators.

== Expressions Supported by Transform to SQL Select

You can find the filtering expressions that OData supports in its http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata/v4.01/cs01/part1-protocol/odata-v4.01-cs01-part1-protocol.html#sec_BuiltinFilterOperations[specification^]. The `transform-to-sql-select` operation supports the following subset of unary and binary operators, and the following method operators.

=== Binary Operators in OData and in SQL

[options="header"]
|====
| OData Operator | SQL Operator
| add | +
| and | AND
| div | /
| eq | =
| ge | >=
| gt | >
| le | =<
| lt | <
| mod | %
| mul | *
| ne | <>
| or | OR
| sub | -
|====

=== Unary Operators in OData and in SQL

[options="header"]
|====
| OData Operator | SQL Operator
| not | NOT
| - | -
|====

=== Method Operators in OData and in SQL

[options="header"]
|====
| OData Operator | SQL Operator
| contains | LIKE %value%
| startswith | LIKE value%
| endswith | LIKE %value
|====

== $search Support

The operation builds a `where` clause based on the `$search` expression the system query option provides. The implementation translates the search expression to select all the elements that have property values that match the condition. By default, a term matches if the field value “contains” the term, but it does not match if set as “strict” in the configuration. The following parameters define the `$search` feature:

[options="header"]
|====
| Parameter Name | Description
| Search transformation enabled | If `true`, it enables the transformation support for this option.
| Strict search term match | If `true`, it specifies that there is a match only if the field value contains exactly the same terms as the search expression.
