== Transforming to SQL Query
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]

endif::[]

APIkit for OData 4 contains a `Transform to SQL Select` operation to transform the input OData `GET` request to a SQL SELECT query. The operation is useful when combined with the `select` operation of the Database Connector. The output payload is a prepared statement and the attributes are a map of prepared statement parameters. This operation has been designed to work with the Mule DB connector to help the user expose databases with OData 4 easily.

APIkit currently supports the following elements:

* System query options:
** $filter
** $select
** $search
** $orderby
** $skip
** $top
* Single entity
* Entity relation
* Server-side pagination

APIkit does not currently support the following elements:

* Parameter Aliases
* Built-in Filter Operations:
** has
** divby
* Built-in Query Functions, all but:
** contains
** startswith
** endwith
* $apply
* $compute
* $expand

=== Transform to SQL Select Operation in OData V4

The OData protocol defines a series of conventions that enable clients to query identified resources using URLs. The list of queryable entities, their fields, and the relationships between them are defined in a data model using simple HTTP messages.
As OData shares some similarities with Java database connectivity (JDBC), the `transform-to-sql-select` operation takes advantage of such similarities to help the user create SQL queries for those resources. The resulting message of the operation is a prepared statement with the SQL `select` sentence as the payload along with the parameters name and values map as the attributes.

=== Implement the Transform to SQL Select Operation Using APIkit for OData V4

`<apikit-odata:transform-to-sql-select>` is the name of the XML element that represents this operation, which has the following parameters:

[options="header"]
|====
| Parameter name | Description
| Display name | This parameter configures the operation name.
| Module configuration | Name of the related-module configuration.
| Entity set name | The name of the entity set that you are trying to fetch #[attributes.entitySetName].
| Page size | A number that defines the amount of results per page during server-side-pagination.
| Entity type name | A string obtained from the OData request using #[attributes.odataRequestAttributes], which is specified by the entity data model.
| Entity type fields | An array of strings obtained from the OData request using #[attributes.odataRequestAttributes], which provides the list of property fields from the entity type.
| Entity type keys | An object obtained from the OData request using #[attributes.odataRequestAttributes], which provides the map of entity key names and values.
| System query options | Parameter obtained from the OData request using #[attributes.odataRequestAttributes].
| Search transformation enabled | Parameter to define the behavior of the transformation.
| Strict search term match | Parameter to define the behavior of the transformation.
|====

=== $filter Expressions in OData V4

​​The `$filter` expression in OData uses comparison, logical, arithmetic, and grouping operators. You can access the list operators with their corresponding meaning at http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata/v4.01/cs01/part1-protocol/odata-v4.01-cs01-part1-protocol.html#sec_BuiltinFilterOperations[the OData4 Specification^]. APIkit does not support `has` and `divby` operators.

=== Expressions Supported by Transform to SQL Select

OData supports a variety of expressions for filtering that you can find in its http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata/v4.01/cs01/part1-protocol/odata-v4.01-cs01-part1-protocol.html#sec_BuiltinFilterOperations[specification^]. The `transform-to-sql-select` operation supports the following subset of unary and binary operators, along with the following method operators.

==== Binary Operators in OData and in SQL

[options="header"]
|====
| OData Operator | SQL Operator
| add | +
| and | AND
| div | /
| eq | =
| ge | >=
| gt | >
| le | =<
| lt | <
| mod | %
| mul | *
| ne | <>
| or | OR
| sub | -
|====

==== Unary Operators in OData and in SQL

[options="header"]
|====
| OData Operator | SQL Operator
| not | NOT
| - | -
|====

==== Method Operators in OData and in SQL

[options="header"]
|====
| OData Operator | SQL Operator
| contains | LIKE %value%
| startswith | LIKE value%
| endswith | LIKE %value
|====

=== $search Support

The operation builds a `where` clause based on the `$search` expression provided by the system query option. The implementation translates the search expression to select all the elements that have property values that match the condition. By default, a term matches if the field value “contains” the term, but it does not match if it is set as “strict” in the configuration. The following parameters define the `$search` feature:

[options="header"]
|====
| Parameter name | Description
| Search transformation enabled | When set to `true`, it enables the transformation support for this option.
| Strict search term match | When set to `true`, it specifies that there is a match only if the field value contains exactly the same terms as the search expression.
