== Configurations

=== Config

Configuration element for a *SOAP Router*

==== Parameters

[cols="1a,2a,3a,4a,5a"]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Name | String | Connectors use this configuration name to reference its configuration. | | *x*
| Soap Version | Enumeration, one of:

* SOAP11
 
* SOAP12 

| SOAP version of the WSDL. |  | 
| Address | String | Address of the web service. |  | 
| MTOM Enabled | Boolean | Defines if the MTOM protocol manages the attachments. | `false` | 
| Inbound Validation Enabled | Boolean | Defines if the MTOM protocol manages the attachments. | `false` |

| Namespace Prefixes | Object |  |  | 
| Expiration Policy | xref:apikit-for-soap-module-reference.adoc#expiration-policy[Expiration Policy] | Configures the minimum amount of time that a dynamic configuration instance can remain idle before the runtime considers it eligible for expiration. The platform does not necessarily expire the instance at the exact moment that it becomes eligible. The runtime actually purges the instances when it sees it fit. |  | 
| WSDL Location | String | WSDL file URL, remote or local. |  | *x*
| Service | String | Name of the service. |  | *x*
| Port | String | Name of the port. |  | *x*

== Types

=== Expiration Policy

[cols="1a,2a,3a,4a,5a", options="header"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Max Idle Time | Number | A scalar time value for the maximum amount of time a dynamic configuration instance is allowed to be idle before it's considered eligible for expiration |  | 
| Time Unit | Enumeration, one of:

* NANOSECONDS

* MICROSECONDS

* MILLISECONDS

* SECONDS

* MINUTES

* HOURS

* DAYS | A time unit that qualifies the `maxIdleTime` attribute |  | 
|===

=== Repeatable in Memory Stream

[cols="1a,2a,3a,4a,5a", options="header"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Initial Buffer Size | Number | Amount of memory that is allocated to consume the stream and provide random access to it. If the stream contains more data than buffer capacity, then it is expanded according to the `bufferSizeIncrement` attribute, with an upper limit of `maxInMemorySize`. |  | 
| Buffer Size Increment | Number | How much buffer size expands if it exceeds its initial size. A value of zero or lower specifies that the buffer does not expand. When the buffer is full, `STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED` error occurs. |  | 
| Max Buffer Size | Number | The maximum amount of memory used. If more is used, a `STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED` error is raised. A value lower or equal to zero means no limit. |  | 
| Buffer Unit | Enumeration, one of:

* BYTE

* KB

* MB

* GB | The unit in which all these attributes are expressed. |  | 
|===

=== Repeatable File Store Stream

[cols="1a,2a,3a,4a,5a", options="header"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| In Memory Size | Number | Defines the maximum memory that the stream uses to keep data in memory. If it consumes more, the stream buffers the content on disk. |  | 
| Buffer Unit | Enumeration, one of:

* BYTE

* KB

* MB

* GB | The unit in which `maxInMemorySize` is expressed. |  |
