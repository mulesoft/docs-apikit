= To Generate a SOAP Fault
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]
include::_attributes.adoc[]
endif::[]

In this procedure, you use the SoapUI tool to identify an operation you need to implement by making the API that fails. You use the OrderTshirt operation to create a request in SOAP UI to place an order for a large t-shirt for John. The API cannot handle this operation and a SOAP fault occurs.

. In a SOAP client, SoapUI for example, create a new SOAP project using the URL for your deployed Mule APIkit project for the initial WSDL. In this workflow, the URL is `+http://localhost:8081/TshirtService/TshirtServicePort?wsdl+`:

+
. In SoapUI, request a large t-shirt for John by entering some values into the request envelope. For example:
+
* Click Projects > TshirtServicePort?wsdl > TshirtServiceSoapBinding > OrderTshirt > Request 1.
* Enter *L* between the `<size>` tags.
+
* Enter *John* between the `<name>` tags.
+
. Submit the request.
+
The result is the SOAP fault.
