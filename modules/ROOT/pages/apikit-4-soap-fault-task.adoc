= Identify Operations to Implement

To know what happens with an implemented operation, you make the API fail using SoapUI. Take the steps of the following example to create a request in SoapUI using the `OrderTshirt` operation to place an order for a large t-shirt for John. Because the API cannot handle this operation, a SOAP fault occurs.

. In SoapUI, create a new SOAP project and put the URL for your deployed Mule APIkit project in the initial WSDL file. +
In this example, the URL is `+http://localhost:8081/TshirtService/TshirtServicePort?wsdl+`.

+
. In SoapUI, request a large t-shirt for John by entering some values into the request envelope:
+
.. Select *Projects* > *TshirtServicePort?wsdl* > *TshirtServiceSoapBinding* > *OrderTshirt* > *Request 1*.
.. Enter *L* between the `<size>` tags.
.. Enter *John* between the `<name>` tags.
. Submit the request.
+
The result is the SOAP fault:
