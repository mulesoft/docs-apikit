== Select Sources

The module sources vary depending on the implementation of your GraphQL API. APIkit for GraphQL provides two kind of sources:
* Data Fetchers
* Data Loaders
Your selection depends on your implementation needs. 
In addition, GraphQL is transport-layer agnostic so you choose the main connector listener depending on the protocol that you want to serve your data.
