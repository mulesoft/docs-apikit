In this procedure, you add a flow to filter users to get a list of user names. You set up the *Transform Message* to return the results you want.

. Copy and paste the *get:/users:api-config* flow to create another flow.
. Select the flow, and then *Edit* > *Copy*. 
. Click a blank area of the canvas, and select *Edit* > *Paste*.
+
A copy of the flow appears at the bottom of the canvas.
+
. In the copy of the flow, select the *HTTP listener* component, and in the properties editor, change the path from */placeholder* to */placeholder/names*.
. Drag a *Transform Message* component from the *Mule Palette* to the right of the *HTTP Requester*.
