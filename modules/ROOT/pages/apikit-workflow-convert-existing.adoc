= Workflow: Convert an Existing Mule Project to an APIkit Project

If you create a new Studio project and do _not_ specify an API definition file,  APIkit generates a skeletal RAML file and XML configuration that includes the following things:

* HTTP Listener configuration
* APIkit Router component
* Error handling flows

The following screenshot shows the Specify API Definition File Location or URL option, which you uncheck to create the backend first:

image::backend-first-project.png["The window displays the project name, the runtime server, and the unchecked option in the Specify API Definition File Location or URL option in the API implementation section."]

Later, you can add an API specification, and then use API Console to simulate the API.

== Add APIkit to an Existing Design

You add APIkit components to an existing design, for example a legacy project that you want to modernize using RAML and APIkit, by creating the RAML code within Studio as follows:

*RAML-based API*

* Define the API definition files.
* Create a main flow, or use an existing one, that includes an HTTP Listener and APIkit Router.
* Generate backend flows.

The generated backend flows contain the core logic of the API, error handling flows, API Console. You need to add REST resource-action pairing.

== Define the API Definition Files

If you want a RAML-backed API, you can use Studio to create the file: Studio: File > New > RAML API Definition.

image::new-raml.png["Window displays the folder, the name, and the title for creating the new RAML API definition file."]

For example:

. Use the RAML specification and dependent JSON example files provided in the Workflow: Generating a Mule Flow from an API Specification.

. Right-click the name of the RAML in /src/main/resources/api and select Validate. Proceed if there are no problems with the RAML.

. Create any dependent files, or drag and drop them into Studio beside the main RAML. For example, drag the user-example.json to /src/main/resources/api.
+
Ignore error messages in the Problems window that pertain to undefined attributes.

== Create a Main Flow

Within the APIkit project, build a flow.

. Drag the following components from the Mule palette:
+
* An HTTP Listener
* An APIkit Router
+
. In the properties editor for APIkit Router, in Router Configuration, select `api-config`.
. In the properties editor for HTTP Listener, in Connector Configuration, select api-httpListenerConfig, and set a path. For example, in Path, enter `/`.


== Generate REST Backend Flows

When you create a RAML in Studio, generating backend flows is optional. Error handling is generated for a RAML-based API. You need to reference generated flows from the main flow. This procedure assumes you have already created a main flow.

To generate backend flows:

. In the Package Explorer, right-click the project name.
. Select Mule > Generate Flows From REST API.
+
The backend flows appear below the main flow.

== Map RAML Resources to Actions

As part of the backend-first design process, you map RAML resources to actions as shown in the following procedure. This procedure assumes you have generated backend flows.

To map resources to actions:

. Click the APIkit Router to open the *Properties Editor*. In *Router configuration*, click image:add-16x16.png["Plus button."].
+
The *Global Element Properties* wizard appears.
+
. Enter the relative path to the RAML file you created within Studio, for example: src/main/resources/api/api.raml. If you browse, the file name alone is used and that isn't sufficient.
. In Mappings, click image:add-16x16.png["Plus button"] to create a new mapping.
+
The *New Mapping* dialog appears.
. Use the drop-down to map the resources to actions.
+
* In the Resource drop-down, select `/users`.
+
* In the Action drop-down, select `GET`.
+
* In the Flow drop-down, select the flow that contains the get users action: `get:\users:api-config`.
+
Click *OK*.
+

+
. Repeat the previous step for each resource-action pairing in the API.

Now, you are ready to run the new project and simulate calls using API Console.
