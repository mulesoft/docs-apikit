In this procedure, you regenerate SOAP flows. After modifying a WSDL, such as adding an operation or editing a message, regeneration is required. Because modifying a WSDL is error-prone, before making a change, make a backup, change the attribute, and verify that the change worked.

To update a WSDL file:

. Download `+https://docs.mulesoft.com/apikit/v/4.x/_attachments/tshirt-modified.wsdl+`.
. Copy the entire contents of the downloaded file.
. In Studio, right-click src/main/resources/api/tshirt2.wsdl, and select Open With > Text Editor.
. Replace the contents in tshirt2.wsdl with the clipboard contents.
+
. In Package Explorer, right-click src/main/resources/api/tshirt2.wsdl and select Mule > Generate Flows From WSDL.
