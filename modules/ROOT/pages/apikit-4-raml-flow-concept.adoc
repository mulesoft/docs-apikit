From a RAML specification, the APIkit scaffolding technique typically generates the following components in APIkit 4.x:

image::scaffolding.png["APIkit scaffolding generates a main API, which includes the listener, the APIkit router, and the error handling."]

* An archetype
+
Basic configuration files plus a Mule XML configuration (Mule code)
+
* An implementation of the API
+
** HTTP listener and APIkit router
+
For routing and binding to RAML resources.
+
** An API Console
+
For simulating calls to the API using the mocking service.
** Flows
+
A mock implementation. Later you need to add the business logic to the flows.

In Studio, the APIkit project looks something like this:

image::apikit-flows.png["The package explorer is displayed with the project files, and the project flow, which highlights the router, the console, and the error handling."]

A flow is generated for each resource method:

The generated, minimal flows meets the communication operations required by a REST contract.

== APIkit Router

The APIkit router is a key message processor that validates requests against the RAML definition, enriches messages, for example by adding default values to the messages, and routes requests to a flow. "Bad request" is returned if the request is invalid, for example, and "Not implemented" is returned if the RAML resource that you request is not associated with a flow.
