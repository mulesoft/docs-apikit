This process walks you through the creation of a new Mule project based on a SOAP API specification.

Before proceeding, ensure that you meet the xref:apikit-4-soap-prerequisites-task.adoc[Prerequisites for Using APIkit for SOAP].

. Under the File menu, select *New* > *Mule Project*.

[calloutlist]
. In *Project Name*, enter a name for the project. +
For example, _soap-implementation_.
. Select the Mule runtime engine version. +
For example, `Mule Server 4.2.2 EE`.
. Under *API Specification*, select the  *From Design Center or Local Files* tab.
. Select the expand icon: image:expand-icon.png[30,35] and select *Browse files...*.

[start=2]
. Select a service and port from the drop-down menus or accept the defaults. For this example, accept the defaults: Select `TshirtService` and `TshirtServicePort`.

+
. Select *Finish*.
+
The new project appears and has a `src/main/resources/api` folder that contains the WSDL file.
. Right-click a blank area of the canvas and choose the option to run the project.
. In your SOAP UI client, go to `+http://localhost:8081/TshirtService/TshirtServicePort?wsdl+`.
+
The SOAP service returns the content of your WSDL file.

If you update your WSDL file, you can regenerate your flows:

. In the Package Explorer view, right-click your WSDL file.
. Select *Mule* > *Generate Flows From WSDL*.
